jQuery Plugin
=============

This module contains infrastructure classes for creating jQuery collection plugins.

* Creates jQuery bridge.
* Handles initialisation including reading settings from metadata.
* Handles option retrieval and update.
* Handles method calling.
* Handles plugin destruction.

This framework is used for many of my jQuery plugins, http://keith-wood.name/index.html#jquery.

For documentation on the functionality see http://keith-wood.name/pluginRef.html.
